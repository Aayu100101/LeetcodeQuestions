Approach 4 - O(1) space complexity.

Explanation - Unlike Approach 3, we won't take two separate arrays. Instead, we use the first row & first column of our matrix only.
              Two things to keep in mind here:
              1. While resetting the values to 0 using lookup table (first row & column of the matrix here), we will traverse from the end because we do not want to manipulate our 
                 lookup arrays at first. After all of the manipulations in the rest of the table is done, we can manipulate our lookup arrays as well.
              2. If we find a 0 in first column, We shouldn't be setting matrix[0][0] to 0 because it will manipulate our whole first row to 0 which is wrong.
                 So, for this case, We will use a boolean variable that will tell us whether we have to make first column to 0 or not (so, we don't require matrix[0][0] value)

Result - Time: Better than 48.24% of the C++ submissions.
         Space : Better than 96.19% of the C++ submissions.

Code - 

class Solution {
public:
  
    void setZeroes(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int r = matrix.size();
        int c = matrix[0].size();
        
        bool temp = true;
        
        for(int i=0;i<r;++i){
            if(matrix[i][0] == 0){
                temp = false;
            }
            for(int j=1;j<c;++j){
                if(matrix[i][j] == 0){
                    matrix[i][0] = 0;
                    matrix[0][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        
        for(int i=r-1;i>=0;--i){
            for(int j=c-1;j>0;--j){
                if(matrix[i][0] == 0 || matrix[0][j] == 0){
                    matrix[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
            if(!temp){
                matrix[i][0] = 0;
            }
        }
        
    }
};
